# Builder Blvd

Builder Blvd is a WordPress plugin in the works, meant to replace [Theme Blvd Layout Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-blvd-layout-builder/) and bring [Jump Start](https://wpjumpstart.com) into the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) era. It combines blocks of [Front Street](https://github.com/themeblvd/frontstreet) with elements originally created in the [Theme Blvd](https://themeblvd.com) WordPress theme framework.

## Requirements

* WordPress 5+ (or [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) + WordPress 4.9)
* PHP 5.3+.
